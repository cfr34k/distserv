DistServ
========

This is a TCP Server which reads data from stdin and forwards it to each connected client.

Originally, this was developed as a notification broadcaster for the [Freifunk-Bot](https://github.com/Bytewerk/freifunk_bot) project, however, as this is quite versatile, I decided to make it standalone.
